\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2  The fields of the fixed RTP header have their usual meaning, with the\
   following additional notes:\
\
   Payload Type (PT): 7 bits\
\
     A dynamically allocated payload type field that designates the\
     payload as uncompressed video.\
\
   Timestamp: 32 bits\
\
     For progressive scan video, the timestamp denotes the sampling\
     instant of the frame to which the RTP packet belongs.  Packets MUST\
     NOT include data from multiple frames, and all packets belonging to\
     the same frame MUST have the same timestamp.\
\
     For interlaced video, the timestamp denotes the sampling instant of\
     the field to which the RTP packet belongs.  Packets MUST NOT\
     include data from multiple fields, and all packets belonging to the\
     same field MUST have the same timestamp.  Use of field timestamps,\
     rather than a frame timestamp and field indicator bit, is needed to\
     support reverse 3-2 pulldown.\
